An *output artifact* is an output emitted by a pipeline component, which the
Kubeflow Pipelines UI understands and can render as rich visualizations. It’s
useful for pipeline components to include artifacts so that you can provide for
performance evaluation, quick decision making for the run, or comparison across
different runs. Artifacts also make it possible to understand how the pipeline’s
various components work. An artifact can range from a plain textual view of the
data to rich interactive visualizations.
